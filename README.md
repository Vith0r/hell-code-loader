## Overview

**Hell Code Loader** is a lightweight proof-of-concept tool for **injecting and executing shellcode** on **Windows** systems with "minimal" detection. It leverages indirect NT syscalls, hardware breakpoints, VEH, and other evasive tactics.

## Features

> *“I know there are better ways to apply this, but I follow a simple logic: if it works for me, that's what matters.”*

1. **Indirect NTAPI Syscalls**  
   - Bypass user-mode API hooks.
2. **AsmHalosGate**  
   - Resolution of syscall service numbers (SSNs) in NTDLL.  
3. **Hardware Breakpoints (HWBP)**  
   - Place breakpoints on `AmsiScanBuffer` and `NtTraceEvent` for on-the-fly patching.  
4. **Thread-Pool DLL Loading**
5. **RC4 Payload Decryption**
6. **Vectored Exception Handling (VEH)**
   - Redirecting the VEH handler's RIP to execute shellcode.

## Evasion Results
*Historically it has been able to bypass the following list of antivirus/edr:*
> **Note:**  
> - This can't be considered a 100% bypass since I only tested it by running Mimikatz commands! 
> - In a properly configured EDR environment, things are different!
> - This ranking list was generated by AI, so I can't guarantee the data is 100% accurate :)

## POC

- **Shellcode Execution** : [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EGTEp_hLz0)  
  Executed Mimikatz shellcode (converted via [donut](https://github.com/TheWover/donut)) without AV detection.

- **DLL Proxy + Hell Code Loader** : [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0fJ3RusIb8)  
  To bypass Bitdefender Total Security and Endpoint Security, I had to implement loader injection through a DLL proxy.
